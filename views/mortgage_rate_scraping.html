  <h4 class="">Scraping and visualising NZ retail mortgage rates</h4>
  <p>
    My mortgage is coming up to roll-over time. So I wanted to get
    a snapshot of what the state of the retail mortgage rate market
    was like. I mean I work in the area anyway so I try to keep an eye
    on what is going on with rates but what I really felt
    like compiling was the comprehensive figures across the market today.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fortunately, <a href="https://mortgagerates.co.nz/mortgage-rates">this
    site</a> seems to do a pretty good job of keeping track of the
    advertised rates across retail lenders. What I'd like to do is to
    make the table provided a little more useful by importing the
    whole thing into R so we can do some analysis and visualisation etc.
  </p>
  <h6 class="docs-header">Scrape the data</h6>
  <p>
    I'm going to use the tidyverse <code>rvest</code> package to do my
    scraping. I'm also going to use a package
    called <code>snakecase</code> to do some low effort case
    manipulation. Now I'm thinking about it I'll also drop in the code
    to reproduce the tables using <code>stargazer</code>. Stargazer is
    normally useful to me as it outputs latex but it is equally useful
    for outputting html and that's what I'm using for this site. I
    just write everything here directly in html files. No blogging
    UI on the backend or anyting like that.
    
    <pre>
      <code>
library(tidyverse)	
library(rvest)
library(stringr)
library(snakecase)
library(stargazer)

      </code>
    </pre>

    First I need to get the html from the page.
    
    <pre>
      <code>
## Get html at mortgagerates.co.nz
url &lt;- 'https://mortgagerates.co.nz/mortgage-rates'
html &lt;- rvest::read_html(url)
      </code>
    </pre>

    Then I need to use the <code>rvest::html_elements</code> function to pare
    down to just the html elements I'm interested in. In this case
    they are any <code>div</code> elements with
    the <code>table-row</code> class.
    
    <pre>
      <code>
## Find elements, extract text and split on the '/n' linebreaks
tmp &lt;- html %&gt;% html_elements(".table-row") %&gt;% html_text2() %&gt;% str_split("\\n")

## I'm also going to get the divs with '.lender-cell' seperately
## because I only want the text in the '.product-name' spans. 
tmp_n &lt;- html %&gt;% html_elements(".table-row") %&gt;%
            html_elements(".lender-cell") %&gt;%
            html_element('.product-name') %&gt;%
            html_text2()

## Hack together a 'pretty' data frame by:
## Binding the rows together
tbl &lt;- as.data.frame(do.call(rbind, tmp[-1]))

## Pushing the column names from the first list element in tmp
names(tbl) &lt;- to_any_case(tmp[[1]], 'snake')
		 
## Replacing the values in the lender column with the tidier values in
## the tmp_n vector
tbl$lender &lt;- tmp_n[-1]

## Tidy up a bit
rm(tmp, tmp_n)

## And then print the first 10 rows of the data frame
tbl %&gt;% head(10) %&gt;% stargazer::stargazer(type = 'text',
summary = F, rownames = F)
      </code>
    </pre>

    That should give us something that looks like this. These are only
    the first 10 rows but it gives us the flavour of the data structure.

  <h6 class="docs-header">Reshape data a little bit</h6>

  <p>
    The data frame above is fine. It's a pretty faithful reproduction
    of what we can read of the mortgagerates.co.nz site. Before
    getting any further with any analysis other than just looking at
    the table it's worth just reshaping the data a little bit.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's convenient for me to change it into a slightly 'longer'
    format and do some additional cleaning. Making the number columns
    numeric and stripping out the % symbols etc.
    
    <pre>
      <code>
## Change to long format based on unique term/rate pairs
long &lt;- pivot_longer(tbl, tail(names(tbl),-1), names_to = 'term', values_to = 'rate')

## strip out the trailing % symbols
long$rate &lt;- long$rate %&gt;% str_replace_all('[-%]', '') %&gt;%
as.numeric()

## New term_n factor variable
long$term_n &lt;- long$term %&gt;% as.factor()

## Recode factor levels to numeric equivalents and change back to numeric
long$term_n &lt;- long$term_n %&gt;% fct_recode('NA' = 'revolving',
                                              '0' = 'floating',
                                              '0.5' = '6_months',
                                              '1' = '1_year',
                                              '1.5' = '18_months',
                                              '2' = '2_years',
                                              '3' = '3_years',
                                              '4' = '4_years',
                                              '5' = '5_years') %&gt;%
as.character() %&gt;% as.numeric()

## Print the first 10 rows of the long format data frame
long %&gt;% head(10) %&gt;% stargazer::stargazer(type = 'text', summary = F,
rownames = F)
      </code>
    </pre>

    The long format data frame should look something like this:

	<th>lender</th>

    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h6 class="docs-header">Finally, a bit of analysis</h6>
  
  <p>
    I wanted to have a look at who was advertising the best deals for
    each mortgage term length (including the revolving and floating
    rates).
    <pre>
      <code>
## Summarise by term length:
## Mean market rate for each term length,
## Lowest rate for each term length,
## And the lender providing the lowest rate
deals &lt;- long %&gt;% group_by(term) %&gt;%
summarise('avg' = mean(rate, na.rm = T),
          'min' = min(rate, na.rm = T),
          'min_bank' = lender[which(rate == min(rate, na.rm = T))])

## Mess around rounding the numbers nicely
deals &lt;- bind_cols(lapply(deals, function(x) {
	   if(is.numeric(x)) { format(x, digits = 3) }
	   else if(is.factor(x)) { as.character(x) }
	   else { x }
	 }))
	 
## Print the resulting table

  <p>
    Um... yes. There's probably a bit to unpack here. Maybe I'll get
    around to it sometime. Maybe not...
  </p>
  
  <h6 class="docs-header">Visualising term structures</h6>

  <p>
    I also want to figure out how my current mortgage providers rates
    look compared to the wider market. Let's be real. It's going to
    just be less hassle to just roll it with the same provider. My
    current lender is Co-op and I'm living in the house so I'm mostly
    just interested in what their owner occupied rates look like
    across all term lengths compared with the broader market.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lets have a look at what <code>ggplot</code> has to say.
    
    <pre>
      <code>
## Plot rates by term grouped by lender/product
## Loess regression (in blue) plots the term condtioned market mean rate
## Co-op owner occupied rates in red
ggplot(data = long %>% filter(term_n >= 0) %>% na.omit(), aes(term_n, rate)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = lender), col = 'light grey') +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_line(data = long %>% filter(lender == 'The Co-operative Bank
    Owner Occupied' & term_n >= 0), aes(term_n, rate), size = 1, col = 'red') +
  theme(legend.position="none")
      </code>
    </pre>
  </p>
    
  <img class="u-max-full-width" src="assets/images/mortgage_rate_scraping.png">

  <p>
    So Co-op look ok, certainly better than the market average but by no
    means the best advertised rate. And maybe the Loess line is a little
    misleading here because there are some lenders like China
    Construction pulling the rates up by charging in the ballpark of
    4.5% on everything from 6 months to 3 years. I should really weight
    the loess by market share.
  </p>
  <p>
    Heartland bank is the crazy line
    down the bottom. I don't know quite what's going on there. It looks
    like it might be a really aggressive play for customers. Maybe there
    are some really restrictive terms attached or something.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is probably just woth noting that in my <code>deals</code>
    table it said that Co-op's 6 month rate was the lowest of all the
    lenders but the graph makes it look like Heartland has a lower 6
    month rate. This is because Heartland don't offer a 6 month rate
    and I've got <code>ggplot</code> to interpolate the lines across
    the missing values because I didn't want broken lines.
  </p>
  <p>
    TLDR; the table is right and the graph can be misleading for the
    sake of looking a little more tidy. As long as we know what's
    going on though we should be fine.
    </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, that's a starting point. You've got everything you need to
    mess around with the numbers more if you want.
